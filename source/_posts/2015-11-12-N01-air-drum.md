Air Drum is a computer vision project. This little game allows players to play “drums” in the screen with their hands captured by webcam. Behind the scene is a computer vision model that reads each camera frame and outputs the location of player's hand. The model is a Convolution Neural Network tained with 15,000 pictures of human hands. One big challenge of this project is how speed up the inference process of the model to make the game smooth. (For example, if the model need 1 second to locate the hands in one image, then the frame rate of the game will be at most 1 FPS, which is too laggy for a game to be playable.) To counter this, I used Multi-threading so that the program can deal multiple frames in the same time, which achieves higher frame rates for smoother real-time interactions.
