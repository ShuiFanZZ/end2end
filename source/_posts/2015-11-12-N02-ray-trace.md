In this project, I implemented a basic volumetric path tracer using Nori framework. So
far I have implemented simple path tracer and path tracer with multiple importance
sampling on Nori in previous assignments. These path tracers only consider surface
interactions between a mesh and light, and assume the space is completely vacuum.
However in real life, the air where light travels can be full of small particles, such
as smoke, fog, and dust. When light enters these participating medium, it will get
scattered and absorbed by the particles. This can lead to some different visual effect
such as the well-known Tyndall effect. The goal of this project is to extend the path
tracer to support this kind of effect.
