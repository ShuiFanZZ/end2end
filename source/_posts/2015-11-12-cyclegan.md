In this project, we implemented the CycleGAN model from scratch using TensorFlow. CycleGAN is an generative adverasrial networks that can translate an input image in one domain to an image in another domain, while the images in these two training datasets are not paired. For example, turning a zebra image into a horse image and vice-versa. The main break-through of this model is the introduction of cycle-consistency. The training of the image generator goes in 2 directions X->Y and Y->X. Cycle consistency adds a constraint that when we generate an image in Y domain from X domain, and subsequently generate it back, the resulting image should still reside in the original domain X.
