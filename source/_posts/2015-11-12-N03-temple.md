This 3D environment was made as a game map for VRChat. The buildings were modeled with Blender, and the terrain was made in Unity. There are environmental sound and light effects associated with this map. Particle effects were used to make the map more lively. Players are also able to interact with the bell. Press E will trigger an animation for ringing the bell.
